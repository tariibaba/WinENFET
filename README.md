If no File Explorer window is open, it will create a new one in the normal way.

**Note**: The Tabs feature for File Explorer is only available in Windows 11 22H2 Stable Build (22621) or later.

   From then on, `Win + E` will open a new File Explorer tab.

### Run WinENFET on startup

You'll likely want to configure the app to run anytime you log in. If you don't know to do this, please follow the steps in Method 2 of [this tutorial](https://allthings.how/how-to-run-an-app-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-11/).

## Limitations

It doesn't work when you press `Win + E` on a virtual desktop when another virtual desktop has an open File Explorer window.
